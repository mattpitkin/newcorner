# scotchcorner

Greatly inspired by [corner.py](https://github.com/dfm/corner.py)), this is an attempt to create a 
slightly different "corner" plot for showing different combinations of projections of samples from
a multi-dimensional parameter space.

## Installation

This code requires numpy, scipy and matplotlib. To make the plots look pretty a
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) version greater than or equal to 1.5.0 is needed.

It can be installed using:

``python setup.py install``

or for (Linux) system-wide installation use:

``sudo python setup.py install``

If you have any suggestions/contributions for the code please create an issue, or fork and generate a pull request.
