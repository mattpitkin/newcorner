# newcorner
Attempts at a new corner plot (greatly inspired by [corner.py](https://github.com/dfm/corner.py))

Requires a matplotlib version greater than or equal to 1.5.1 for pretty plots.

Install using:

``python setup.py install``

or for (Linux) system-wide installation use:

``sudo python setup.py install``

If you have any suggestions/contributions for the code please create an issue, or fork and generate a pull request.
